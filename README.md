# Flyspresso-CAD-files
These are the CAD files for the Hybridizer (Flyspresso) liquid handling device developed by Jeff Jordan, Peter Polidoro, and Jon Arnold.

To get started, open the file: _24W.iam which contains a final assembly of the device. 
If you do not have any CAD-viewing software, all of the .iam and .ipt files open with the free program: [eDrawings](https://www.edrawingsviewer.com/)

The Hybridizer robot runs on a python package, which was developed and maintained by Peter Polidoro. See this respository: [hybridizer_python](https://github.com/janelia-pypi/hybridizer_python/tree/digital)
