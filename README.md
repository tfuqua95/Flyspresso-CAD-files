# Flyspresso-CAD-files
These are the CAD files for the Hybridizer (Flyspresso) liquid handling device developed by Jeff Jordan, described in [Fuqua et al., 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.046052v1).

To view these files, open: _24W.iam which contains a final assembly of the device. 
If you do not have any CAD-viewing software, all of the .iam and .ipt files open with the free program: [eDrawings](https://www.edrawingsviewer.com/).

The Hybridizer robot runs on a python package, which was developed and maintained by Peter Polidoro. See this respository: [hybridizer_python](https://github.com/janelia-pypi/hybridizer_python/tree/digital).

Circuit boards and the Arduino controller were also developed by Peter Polidoro. See this repository: [mixed_signal_controller](https://github.com/janelia-modular-devices/mixed_signal_controller).
If you do not have the software to view these schematics, the free program: [KiCAD](https://kicad-pcb.org/) works.

If you are looking for the adaptive microscopy feedback plugin, see this repository: [feedback-fly-embryo-crocker](https://git.embl.de/grp-almf/feedback-fly-embryo-crocker).
